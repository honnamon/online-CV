        <h2>Work Experince</h2>
        <li>October 2022-April 2023 Manufacturing Engineer at Turkish Aerospace Industries
            <p>Was responsible from forming manufacturing plannings of transmission detail parts for helicopters, aircrafts and test specimens. These plannings include machining, surface treatment and heat treatment stations.
            <p>Formed manufacturing plannings according to technical drawings, used Siemens NX to add visual information for the production line.</p>
            <p>Mentored people who started after me to the same team.</p>
                </p></li>
        <li>July 2022-August 2022 Engineering Intern at Turkish Aerospace Industries 
            <p>Had working experience in the department of material characterization and testing. Focused on dynamic tests such as high cycle fatigue, low cycle fatigue, short crack fatigue tests with ACPD method according to ASTM E647, E606 and E466. 
            <p>Learnt how to place specimens to the servo-hydraulic and magnetic resonance fatigue testing machines. Learned how to place an extensometer to the specimen. Also conducted surface roughness analysis.  </p>
                </p></li>
        <li>December 2021-June 2022 Long Term Intern at Turkish Aerospace Industries
            <p>Had working experience in the department of material characterization and testing. Observed tests done on composite and steel materials. These tests are physicochemical, static and dynamic tests such as tensile, impact and compression tests, fatigue crack growth tests.</p>
            <p>Prepared presentations related to fatigue crack growth, physicochemical tests, ASTM standards related to conducted tests and strain gages.
                </p> </li>
        <li>July 2021-August 2021 Engineering Intern at ASELSAN
            <p>Had working experience in all parts of the material inspection and production department. Observed processes of torch and vacuum brazing for aluminum parts that are used in radar systems.</p>
            <p>Conducted quality control steps such as hardness measurement, tensile testing, non-destructive chemical analysis. Also conducted microstructure analysis.
